title: Inference, Evaluation, and Export
---

This document provides a guide on how to perform inference, evaluation, and export models using the Gemma Fine-Tuning Services platform. It covers running inference on fine-tuned models, evaluating their performance, and exporting them in various formats for deployment.

## Evaluating Model Performance

Evaluation involves:

1. generating responses from the model

2. scoring the responses based on various metrics / validating against the dataset ground truth.

### Built-in Evaluation Suites

(Coming soon)

### Benchmarking with Custom Datasets

(Coming soon)

### Vibe-checking with running inference

You can compare models soon too!

## Exporting to different formats

Guidance on export formats (GGUF, adapters, merged checkpoints) and destination options (local, HF Hub, cloud storage) will be added here.
