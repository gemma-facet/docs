## What is Facet AI?

Facet AI is a **no-code** platform that makes fine-tuning Gemma models accessible to everyone. Whether you're a developer or business user, you can create custom language models tailored to your specific needs with our streamlined platform and user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

Fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) are often more **cost-effective and performant** for specific use cases compared to generic LLMs. Learn more with [this article from Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/beginner-start-here/faq-+-is-fine-tuning-right-for-me). Facet AI simplifies this process with:

<Card title="Easy Dataset Preparation" icon="database">
  Upload your data or connect to Hugging Face Hub. We handle formatting for language modeling, preference tuning, and multimodal tasks.
</Card>

<Card title="Multiple Model Sizes" icon="computer">
  Fine-tune Gemma 3 models from 270M to 27B parameters, including Gemma 3n variants, using SFT, DPO, and GRPO.
</Card>

<Card title="Built-in Evaluation" icon="chart-line">
  Test your models with comprehensive inference and evaluation suites to measure performance before deployment.
</Card>

<Card title="Flexible Export" icon="download">
  Export models in multiple formats (adapter, merged, GGUF) with various quantizations for deployment anywhere.
