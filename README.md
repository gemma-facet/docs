## Development

Our docs use Mintlify, a tool for building beautiful documentation sites.

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `docs.json` is located:

```bash
mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `mint update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json` (from the root of this repo)
