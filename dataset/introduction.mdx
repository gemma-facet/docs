Turn raw text or multimodal data into training‑ready conversations in a few steps. You can upload files (CSV, JSON/JSONL, Parquet, Excel) or import from Hugging Face, and optionally include images for vision‑language tasks. Choose a processing mode that matches your objective (language modeling, prompt‑only, or preference tuning) and produce a clean, consistent dataset for training.

<Steps>
<Step title="Pick your data source">
  Upload a file or import a Hugging Face dataset by repository name.
  <Note>
    Supports text and image data for multimodal training.
  </Note>
  
</Step>
<Step title="Map fields to roles">
  Point columns/keys to conversation roles (system, user, assistant) or to chosen/rejected pairs for preference data.
</Step>
<Step title="Choose processing mode">
  Select Language Modeling, Prompt‑only, or Preference Tuning to shape the output format.
</Step>
<Step title="Preview and validate">
  Inspect a sample of the processed dataset and fix any mapping issues.
  <Check>
    Confirm examples look correct before running the full job.
  </Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Process and version">
  Run the job to generate a training‑ready dataset you can reuse across experiments.
</Step>
</Steps>

Next: open the [Datasets page](/dataset/datasets.mdx) to create your first processed dataset.
