## What You Can Do

Facet's preprocessing service transforms your raw data into the perfect format for fine-tuning Gemma models. Whether you have text conversations, images, or structured data, we'll help you prepare it for training.

## Supported Data Formats

### Text-Only Datasets

- **CSV files**: Structured data with columns for prompts, responses, etc.
- **JSON/JSONL**: Conversational data or structured examples
- **Parquet**: Efficient columnar format for large datasets
- **Excel**: Spreadsheet data with multiple sheets

### Multimodal Datasets

- **Images**: PNG, JPEG, or other common formats
- **Text + Images**: Combined content for vision-language tasks
- **Base64 encoded**: Images embedded directly in your data

### Hugging Face Integration

- **Public datasets**: Access thousands of pre-existing datasets
- **Private repositories**: Use your own HF datasets with authentication
- **Subset selection**: Choose specific splits or subsets of larger datasets

## Processing Modes

Facet supports different processing modes depending on your fine-tuning goals:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Language Modeling">
  **Best for**: General conversation, instruction following, text generation
  
  Converts your data into conversational format with `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles.
  
  <Tip>
  This is the most common mode for general-purpose fine-tuning tasks.
  </Tip>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Prompt-Only">
  **Best for**: Reasoning tasks, math problems, structured thinking Creates
  prompts without assistant responses, perfect for GRPO training.
  <Note>
    Use this when you want the model to learn reasoning patterns from your data.
  </Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Preference Tuning">
  **Best for**: Aligning models with human preferences, RLHF
  
  Formats data with `chosen` and `rejected` responses for DPO/ORPO training.
  
  <Warning>
  Requires paired examples showing preferred vs. non-preferred responses.
  </Warning>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Your Data Source">
  Upload a file from your computer or import from Hugging Face Hub.
  
  <Note>
  For Hugging Face datasets, you'll need the repository name (e.g., "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium").
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Field Mappings">
  Map your data columns to the appropriate conversation roles. For example: -
  `question` → `user` role - `answer` → `assistant` role - `instruction` →
  `system` role
</Step>

<Step title="Select Processing Mode">
  Choose the mode that matches your fine-tuning objective.
  <Check>
    The platform will automatically detect if you're using images and enable
    vision processing.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Review and Process">
  Preview your processed data and start the preprocessing job.
  
  <Tip>
  You can always reprocess your dataset with different settings if needed.
  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once your dataset is processed, you can:

- **Start Training**: Use your processed dataset to fine-tune a Gemma model
- **Preview Results**: Review sample conversations to ensure quality
- **Export Data**: Download your processed dataset for external use
- **Create Variations**: Process the same data with different settings
